The very first gift I  remember receiving was a computer from my grandmother when I was 3 or 4 years old. I remember being completely fascinated by the things it could do. Since then, as is the case with most millennials, technology has been a huge part of my everyday life. I remember spending hours on Myspace crafting the perfect layout for myself and my friends. Little did I know I was literally programming the computer to display the profile that I wanted the world to see. This influenced me to take a couple Intro to Programming classes in high school and college, but I never dove in completely. I went on to receive my Bachelor's Degree in Communication with a minor in Spanish from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. After college, I found full-time work as a Finance Assistant. Since then I have worked my way up to Assistant Manager of Operations. While I have enjoyed the experience and have gained a lot of valuable skills - something always brings me back to computers & tech. After researching and reflecting on my love for technology and language, I found the Flatiron Full Stack Web Development program and sent in my application. 

A few things I'd love to embrace while on my journey to becoming a software engineer include:

**Creativity**
Thanks to my Myspace days, I have fallen in love with the front end of software development. I am absolutely obsessed with how creative it allows you to be. Something about the thought of using my technological skills to create every single day really gets me excited about this program I am on. 

**Community**
I am a big fan of community and sharing our experiences with others. I think life is easier done with the help and support from others. So far in my experience with Flatiron I can see how much of a community the programming world is. I look forward to continuing to meet more people and gain insight from others who have gone through this journey as well. 

**Compassion**
I believe that without compassion, the world would stop turning. We must be kind to ourselves and our neighbors in order to succeed and when I first learned of MINSWAN, I knew I was in the right place. MINSWAN is a saying used by Rubyists that stands for "Matz is nice so we are nice". Matz is a nickname for the creator of Ruby, Yukihiro Matsumoto. He created Ruby with the goal of making programmers happy. I think this example of compassion is just one of many in the programming world and I look forward to spreading the compassion myself.
